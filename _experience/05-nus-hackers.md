NUS Hackers is an organization in NUS promoting the hacking (building) of any things possible. I am currently hosting a weekly technical talk, dubbed "Friday Hacks", in which I invite speakers to come down and talk about an interesting technical topic. Previously, I maintained NUS Hackers's digest (blog), as well as taught HTML and CSS in NUS Hackers's workshop Hackerschool to around 100 people.
