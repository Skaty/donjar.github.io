title: Garena Labs Internship (May 2016 - August 2016)

In my first summer break in NUS, I interned in Garena, one of the biggest tech companies in Southeast Asia. I worked on the backend, on things such as Django and SQL.

In one of my main projects, I denormalized an existing database by extracting data out using Django, and added real-time data through the messaging queue system Apache Kafka.
