title: Garena Labs Internship (May 2016 - August 2016)

In my first summer break in NUS, I interned in Garena, one of the biggest tech companies in Southeast Asia. I worked on the backend, using Django to improve websites, create APIs, and so on.

In one of my main projects, I denormalized an existing database by extracting data out using Django's ORM. I combined them with live data as well, through the messaging queue system Apache Kafka. I then created an API to query the results of these data.
