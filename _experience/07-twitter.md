title: Twitter Data Science Internship (May 2017 - August 2017)
---
I worked on the Data Science team in Twitter Singapore. I used Scalding, a Scala library, to write MapReduce jobs.

In my main project, I processed Twitter's Traffic Attribution dataset, which is about traffic coming to Twitter. These data were then classified into several categories based on two dimensions: sources, such as "Email", "Push Notifications", "Business Deals", and so on, and domains, such as "Search Engine", "Blogs", "Adult Websites" and so on. I then visualized the resulting data in Tableau, which were then used to gain a high-level overview of traffic coming into Twitter.

I also did an analysis of emails Twitter sent and presented them to a project manager, informing her on the types of email that drive traffic.
