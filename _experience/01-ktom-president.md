I was the president of Open Online Math Contest, an organization formed by Indonesia's national math olympiad medallists. We host online and free monthly math contests, with problems ranging from high school level problems to problems in the national olympiad level. We aim to empower Indonesians with accessible math olympiad training, allowing everyone to learn and practice easily.
