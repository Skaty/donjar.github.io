title: "Teaching Assistant of NUS CS2020: Data Structures and Algorithms Accelerated (Jan 2017 - Apr 2017)"
---
I was one of the teaching assistants in the course CS2020 (Data Structures and Algorithms Accelerated) in NUS, my university. I tutored 11 students in the span of one semester. Tasks include: preparing slides and extra problems for students, discussing problems two hours weekly, grading and giving feedback to problem sets, providing consultations, and grading the coding quiz.
