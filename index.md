__Herbert Ilhan Tanujaya__ is a second year Indonesian currently studying Computer Science in the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg).

I enjoy creating software and hacking all things possible. Software engineering provides me a medium to actually craft something that can be useful for the society. The lines of code I craft live in a server, yet it can be used to empower people and solve problems.

Coming to university, I had almost zero programming experience yet a very strong background in mathematics, as I represented Indonesia in winning [2 bronze medals](http://imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=24942) in the International Mathematics Olympiad (2014 and 2015). As an IMO alumni I have always been interested in improving olympiad Mathematics in Indonesia, and Computer Science has helped me achieve that dream. I was the president of the [Indonesian Math Online Contest](https://ktom.tomi.or.id) at 2016. One of my biggest contributions is the creation of the organization's [website](https://github.com/donjar/kontes-terbuka) that serves as a math olympiad system.

I'm also part of the [NUS Hackers](http://nushackers.org) coreteam. NUS Hackers is a student interest group dedicated in spreading hacker culture and awareness throughout various ways such as annual hackathons, weekly talks and workshops.

Here's my [resume](https://github.com/donjar/Awesome-CV/raw/master/resume.pdf). And my [Github](https://github.com/donjar). And my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/herbert-ilhan-tanujaya-0ba1b5109).
