title: Open Online Math Contest Website (Ruby on Rails for web)
---
A web application for the organization Open Online Math Contest in Indonesia. Made in Ruby on Rails, this system allows users to submit answers (both short answers and essays) through this website. Uploading problems, short answers gradings, collation of results, and sending certificates are done automatically.

This app was my first major project and I learned so much along the way. I started from scratch by learning basic Ruby on Rails. Since then, I've learned things like complex SQL queries (and how to construct them in ActiveRecord), basic security, integration with APIs like Mailgun (for emails), app testing along with Travis CI, and even how to set up a server in NGINX and Unicorn, along with one-click deployment with Capistrano.
