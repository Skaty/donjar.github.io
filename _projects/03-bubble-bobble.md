title: Bubble Bobble
---
An iOS game similar to Bubble Mania/Puzzle Bobble, in which players shoot and try to match 3 bubbles of the same color (this has nothing in common with the original Bubble Bobble!). I built almost everything from scratch, including a Physics engine and a level editor.

This app was also made in NUS CS3217, serving me as an introduction in building iOS apps in general (Swift, CocoaPods, Apple's MVC, and so on.)
