An iOS application made to help improve English users' command of Chinese through a gamified educational app. This game features minigames of varying difficulty as well as incentives to let users train regularly.

This app was made as a final project in NUS CS3217 (Software Engineering for Modern Application Platforms). In a team of four, we used the MVVM architechture to easily separate concerns. This provides me a real experience in collaborating with teammates on dividing work, code review, discussing over things, and so on. I contributed in the game logic.
